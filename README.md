Zomato Product Teardown & Feature Proposal
📌 Overview

This project presents a comprehensive product teardown of Zomato, focusing on analyzing the end-to-end user journey to identify key friction points and propose data-backed feature solutions to improve user experience, ordering efficiency, and conversion rates.

The analysis follows a user-first, product-thinking approach, combining qualitative insights with structured prioritization using the RICE framework.

🎯 Objectives

Understand Zomato’s complete ordering funnel from discovery to checkout

Identify major friction points impacting user decision-making and order completion

Propose scalable, high-impact product features aligned with business goals

Prioritize solutions using a structured product framework

🔍 Product Teardown Methodology

Mapped end-to-end user journeys across:

Restaurant discovery

Pricing evaluation

Menu browsing

Cart and checkout flow

Analyzed friction points related to:

Choice overload

Price comparison complexity

Large group ordering limitations

Identified 4 core friction areas across pricing, ordering, and checkout stages

💡 Proposed Feature Solutions
1️⃣ Zomato Quick Meals

Problem:
Users experience choice paralysis due to excessive menu options and complex pricing comparisons.

Solution:

Introduced instant price-based meal comparisons

Enables users to quickly select cost-effective meal options without browsing multiple restaurants

Reduces decision time and improves order completion rates

2️⃣ Zomato Party

Problem:
Group orders require placing multiple individual orders across restaurants, increasing friction and drop-offs.

Solution:

Designed a multi-restaurant single order flow for large group orders

Allows users to combine items from multiple restaurants into one checkout experience

Improves convenience and increases high-value order frequency

📊 Prioritization Framework

Both feature proposals were evaluated using the RICE framework:

Reach – Expected user impact

Impact – Improvement in user experience and business metrics

Confidence – Assumptions based on observed user behavior

Effort – Development and operational complexity

This ensured that the proposed solutions are high-impact, feasible, and scalable.
